# Mask LeetCode üöÄ

I'm a big fan of **LeetCode** and have been solving a lot of questions on it. I've noticed that people often give up on hard or medium questions just by seeing the difficulty tag on the problem. To combat this, I've created a _simple Chrome extension_ that hides or masks the difficulty tags so that no one gives up on a question just because of its difficulty. This encourages users to give it a try without any preconceived notions.

## Features

- üîç Replaces "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" difficulty tags with "ü§î" on LeetCode.
- üöÄ Works dynamically as new content loads on the page.
- üåê Lightweight and easy to install.

## How It Works

The extension uses a content script to scan and modify the text content of elements on the LeetCode page. It observes changes in the DOM and ensures that any newly loaded content is also processed.

### Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**: The scripting language used to develop the extension.
- **Chrome Extensions API**: Provides the framework to build the extension.
- **HTML**: Used for the extension's manifest file.
